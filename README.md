# OrderedArrayList
Group Discussion
For the NoNullArrayList, check if the inputs are null, and if they are return an error message. If not, use the normal methods
Some confusion about if an ArrayList can start off with null values and if we need to remove those in the constructor or something
^^ I thought that the input of the NoNullArrayList was an ArrayList...

For the OrderedArrayList, we said to find the index to add the value and then add it at that index. Use a loop over the current OrderedArrayList and use CompareTo to find the suitable index. Had a discussion about whether or not we can compare/order Strings and determined that we can.
